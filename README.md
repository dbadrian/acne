Well... was another 3am "...would this work" project.

Instead of explicitly writing a chainer dnn network as python code, you can generate it from a json file with this (no total freedom though)... some w
also generates some other code to run/train it, including some parallel train code parts. im pretty sure this code wont run out-of-the-box as it might depends on 
on some other project of mine....

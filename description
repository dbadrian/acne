Two Fold:

	- Generate a network.py file from the the json file
	- Generate a runner.py file, which runs the network


GENERATE NETWORK:

	0) Validate the json based on must-have values
	and if a minimum of certain things are defined, such as layers etc.

	i) 	Generate dictionary containing "name": function
	ii) 

	Use
		getattr(object, attrname)
		setattr(object, attrname, value)
	to set parameters


	todo:

	change outer layer to lists, as a dict is really not required on that scope
	we need ordereddict otherwise, but still we only iterate over it anyWAY
